<p>Proctor: No, no. I have signed it, You have seen me. It is done! You have no
need for this.</p>
<p>Parris: Proctor, the village must have proof that -</p>
<p>Proctor: Damn the village! I confess to God, and God has seen my name on
this! It is enough!</p>
<p>Danforth: No, sir, it is -</p>
<p>Proctor: You came to save my soul, did you not? Here! I have confessed
myself; it is enough!</p>
<p>Danforth: You have not con -</p>
<p>Proctor: I have confessed myself! Is there no good penitence but it be public?
God does not need my name nailed upon the church! God sees my name; God
knows how black my sins are! It is enough!</p>
<p>Danforth: Mr. Proctor -</p>
<p>Proctor: You will not use me! I am no Sarah Good or Tituba,
I am John Proctor! You will not use me! It is no part of salva-tion that you should use
me!</p>
<p>Danforth: I do not wish to -</p>
<p>Proctor: I have three children - how may I teach them to walk like men in the
world, and I sold my friends?</p>
<p>Danforth: You have not sold your friends -</p>
<p>Proctor: Beguile me not! I blacken all of them when this is nailed to the church
the very day they hang for silence!</p>
<p>Danforth: Mr. Proctor, I must have good and legal proof that you -</p>
<p>Proctor: You are the high court, your word is good enough! Tell them I
confessed myself; say Proctor broke his knees and wept like a woman; say what
you will, but my name cannot -</p>
<p>Danforth, with suspicion: It is the same, is it not? If I report it or you sign to it?</p>
<p>Proctor - he knows it is insane: No, it is not the same! What others say and what
I sign to is not the same!</p>
<p>Danforth: Why? Do you mean to deny this confession when you are free?</p>
<p>Proctor: I mean to deny nothing!</p>
<p>Danforth: Then explain to me, Mr. Proctor, why you will not let -</p>
<p>Proctor, with a cry of his whole soul: Because it is my name! Because I cannot
have another in my life! Because I lie and sign myself to lies! Because I am not
worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name?
I have given you my soul; leave me my name! </p>
