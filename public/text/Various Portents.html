Several billion elliptical galaxies, bubble nebulae, binary systems,&lt;br/&gt;
Various dust lanes, various routes through varying thicknesses of Dark,&lt;br/&gt;
Many tunnels into deep space, minds going back and forth.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>Many visions, many digitally enhanced heavens,&lt;br/&gt;
All kinds of glistenings being gathered into telescopes:&lt;br/&gt;
Fireworks, gasworks, white-streaked works of Dusk,&lt;br/&gt;

And all sorts of drystone stars put together without mortar.&lt;br/&gt;
Many Wisemen remarking the irregular weather.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>Many exile energies, many low-voiced followers,&lt;br/&gt;
Watches of wisp of various glowing spindles,&lt;br/&gt;
Soothsayers, hunters in the High Country of the Zodiac,&lt;br/&gt;
Seafarers tossing, tied to a star . . .&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>Various people coming home (some of them kings). Various headlights.&lt;br/&gt;
Two or three children standing or sitting on the low wall.&lt;br/&gt;
Various winds, the Sea Wind, the sound-laden Winds of Evening&lt;br/&gt;
Blowing the stars towards them, bringing snow.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
