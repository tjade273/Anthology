<h1>Mirror</h1><h3>By Sylvia Plath<h3><h5>Contributed by Kristin Goodell</h5><p>I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.<br />Whatever I see I swallow immediately<br />Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.<br />I am not cruel, only truthful &sbquo;<br />The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br />Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<br />It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<br />I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.<br />Faces and darkness separate us over and over.<br /><br />Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,<br />Searching my reaches for what she really is.<br />Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<br />I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.<br />She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<br />I am important to her. She comes and goes.<br />Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<br />In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<br />Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.</p>
