Achilles and the Tortoise happen upon each other
in the park one day while strolling.</br>
Tortoise: Good day, Mr. A.</br>
Achilles: Why, same to you. Tortoise: So nice to run into you. Achilles: That echoes my
thoughts.</br>
Tortoise: And it&#39;s a perfect day for a walk. I think I&#39;ll be walking home soon.</br>
Achilles: Oh, really? I guess there&#39;s nothing better for you than w Tortoise: Incidentally,
you&#39;re looking in very fine fettle these days, I must say.</br>
Achilles: Thank you very much.</br>
Tortoise: Not at all. Here, care for one of my cigars?</br>
Achilles: Oh, you are such a philistine. In this area, the Dutch contributions are of
markedly inferior taste, don&#39;t you think?</br>
Tortoise: I disagree, in this case. But speaking of taste, I finally saw that Crab Canon by
your favorite artist, M. C. Escher, in a gallery the other day, and I fully appreciate the
beauty and ingenuity with which he made one single theme mesh with itself going
both backwards and forwards. But I am afraid I will always feel Bach is superior to
Escher. </br>
Achilles: I don&#39;t know. But one thing for certain is that I don&#39;t worry about arguments of
taste. De gustibus non est disputandum.</br>
Tortoise: Tell me, what&#39;s it like to be your age? Is it true that one has no worries at all?</br>
Achilles: To be precise, one has no frets.</br>
Tortoise: Oh, well, it&#39;s all the same to me.</br>
Achilles: Fiddle. It makes a big difference, you know. Tortoise: Say, don&#39;t you play the
guitar?</br>
Achilles: That&#39;s my good friend. He often plays, the fool. But I myself wouldn&#39;t touch a
guitar with a ten-foot pole!</br>
(Suddenly, the Crab, appearing from out of nowhere, wanders up excitedly,
pointing to a rather prominent black eye.)</br>
Crab: Hallo! Hulloo! What&#39;s up? What&#39;s new? You see this bump, this lump? Given to
me by a grump. Ho! And on such a fine day. You see, I was just idly loafing about the
park when up lumbers this giant fellow from Warsaw-a colossal bear of a manplaying
a lute. He was three meters tall, if I&#39;m a day. I mosey on up to the chap, reach
skyward and manage to tap him on the knee, saying, &quot;Pardon me, sir, but you are
Pole-luting our park with your mazurkas.&quot; But wow! he had no sense of humor-not a
bit, not a wit-and POW!-he lets loose and belts me one, smack in the eye! Were it in
my nature, I would crab up a storm, but in the time-honored tradition of my species, I
backed off. After all, when we walk forwards, we move backwards. It&#39;s in our genes,
you know, turning round and round. That reminds me-I&#39;ve always wondered, &quot;Which
came first-the Crab, or the Gene?&quot; That is to say, &quot;Which came last the Gene, or the
Crab?&quot; I&#39;m always turning things round and round, you know. It&#39;s in our genes, after
all. When we walk backwards, we move forwards. Ah me, oh my! I must lope along
on my merry way-so off I go on such a fine day. Sing &quot;ho!&quot; for the life of a Crab!
TATA! iOle!</br>
(And he disappears as suddenly as he arrived.)</br>
Tortoise: That&#39;s my good friend. He often plays the fool. But I myself wouldn&#39;t touch a
ten-foot Pole with a guitar!</br>
Achilles: Say, don&#39;t you play the guitar? Tortoise: Fiddle. It makes a big difference,</br>
Achilles: Oh, well, it&#39;s all the same to me.</br>
Tortoise: To be precise, one has no frets.</br>
Achilles: Tell me, what&#39;s it like to be your age? Is it true that one has no worries at all?</br>
Tortoise: I don&#39;t know. But one thing for certain is that I don&#39;t worry about arguments of
taste. Disputandum non est de gustibus. </br>
Achilles: I disagree, in this case. But speaking of taste, I finally heard that Crab Canon
by your favorite composer, J. S. Bach, in a concert other day, and I fully appreciate
the beauty and ingenuity with which he made one single theme mesh with itself going
both backwards and forwards. But I&#39;m afraid I will always feel Escher is superior to
Bach</br>
Tortoise: Oh, you are such a philistine. In this area, the Dutch contributions are of
