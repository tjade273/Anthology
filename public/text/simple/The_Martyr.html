<h1>The Martyr</h1>
<h3>By Herman Melville</h3>
<dl>
                      <dt>GOOD Friday<br>
                      was the day<br>
                      Of the prodigy and crime,<br>
                      When they killed him in his pity,<br>
                      When they killed him in his prime<br>
                      Of clemency and calm--<br>
                      When with yearning he was filled<br>
                      To redeem the evil-willed,<br>
                      And, though conqueror, be kind;<br>
                      But they killed him in his kindness,<br>
                      In their madness and their blindness,<br>
                      And they killed him from behind.
                      </dt><dt>&nbsp;
                      </dt><dt>There is sobbing of the strong,<br>
                      And a pall upon the land;<br>
                      But the People in their weeping<br>
                      Bare the iron hand:<br>
                      Beware the People weeping<br>
                      When they bare the iron hand.
                      </dt><dt>&nbsp;
                      </dt><dt>He lieth in his blood--<br>
                      The father in his face;<br>
                      They have killed him, the Forgiver--<br>
                      The Avenger takes his place,<br>
                      The Avenger wisely stern,<br>
                      Who in righteousness shall do<br>
                      What the heavens call him to,<br>
                      And the parricides remand;<br>
                      For they killed him in his kindness,<br>
                      In their madness and their blindness,<br>
                      And his blood is on their hand.

                      </dt><dt>There is sobbing of the strong,<br>
                      And a pall upon the land;<br>
                      But the People in their weeping<br>
                      Bare the iron hand:<br>
                      Beware the People weeping<br>
                      When they bare the iron hand.
