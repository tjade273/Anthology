<p>Various stars. Various kings.<br>
Various sunsets, signs, cursory insights.<br>
Many minute attentions, many knowledgeable watchers,<br>
Much cold, much overbearing darkness.<br></p>
<p>Various long midwinter Glooms.<br>
Various Solitary and Terrible Stars.<br>
Many Frosty Nights, many previously Unseen Sky-flowers.<br>
Many people setting out (some of them kings) all clutching at stars.<br></p>
<p>More than one North Star, more than one South Star.<br>
Several billion elliptical galaxies, bubble nebulae, binary systems,<br>
Various dust lanes, various routes through varying thicknesses of Dark,<br>
Many tunnels into deep space, minds going back and forth.<br></p>
<p>Many visions, many digitally enhanced heavens,<br>
All kinds of glistenings being gathered into telescopes:<br>
Fireworks, gasworks, white-streaked works of Dusk,<br>
Works of wonder and/or water, snowflakes, stars of frost . . .<br></p>
<p>Various dazed astronomers dilating their eyes,<br>
Various astronauts setting out into laughterless earthlessness,<br>
Various 5,000-year-old moon maps,<br>
Various blindmen feeling across the heavens in braille.<br></p>
<p>Various gods making beautiful works in bronze,<br>
Brooches, crowns, triangles, cups and chains,<br>
And all sorts of drystone stars put together without mortar.<br>
Many Wisemen remarking the irregular weather.<br></p>
<p>Many exile energies, many low-voiced followers,<br>
Watches of wisp of various glowing spindles,<br>
Soothsayers, hunters in the High Country of the Zodiac,<br>
Seafarers tossing, tied to a star . . .<br></p>
<p>Various people coming home (some of them kings). Various headlights.<br>
Two or three children standing or sitting on the low wall.<br>
Various winds, the Sea Wind, the sound-laden Winds of Evening<br>
Blowing the stars towards them, bringing snow.<br></p>
