<h3 id="by-gayatri-nagnoor">By Gayatri Nagnoor</h3>
<p>Some dreams<br>
Have screams;<br>
They are called nightmares.<br>
At times I don’t care,<br>
But they do affect me,<br>
Can’t you see?<br></p>
<p>Why do the screams haunt me so?<br>
I’m as innocent as a doe.<br>
They follow me everywhere,<br>
How can they dare?!<br>
It should be against the law,<br>
I know what I saw.<br></p>
<p>Dreams<br>
Should be clean,<br>
With happy people,<br>
Not toppling steeples.<br>
They should have sunshine,<br>
Not be as dark as a coal mine.<br>
Why should the darkness leave?<br>
Because we want peace,<br>
Not famine and war.<br>
We need to be as before,<br>
Before everyone,<br>
We will have won.<br></p>
<p>So that we may dream<br>
Without screams,<br>
And darkness will be<br>
Fought off fearlessly.<br></p>
