<h3 id="by-william-cullen-bryant">By William Cullen Bryant</h3>
<p>THE MELANCHOLY days are come, the saddest of the year,<br>Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere.<br>Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;<br>They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbitâ€™s tread.<br>The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay,<br>And from the wood-top calls the crow through all the gloomy day.    </p>
<p>Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood<br>In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?<br>Alas! they all are in their graves, the gentle race of flowers<br>Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours.<br>The rain is falling where they lie, but the cold November rain<br>Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.    </p>
<p>The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,<br>And the brier-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;<br>But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,<br>And the yellow sun-flower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,<br>Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,<br>And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.    </p>
<p>And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,<br>To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;<br>When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,<br>And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,<br>The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,<br>And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.    </p>
<p>And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,<br>The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side.<br>In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,<br>And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:<br>Yet not unmeet it was that one like that young friend of ours,<br>So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.            </p>
