The air held a keenness that made her nose twitch. The harvesting of the corn and cotton, peanuts and squash, made each day a golden surprise that caused excited little tremors to run up her jaws.</p>\n<p>Myop carried a short, knobby stick. She struck out at random at chickens she liked, and worked out the beat of a song on the fence around the pigpen. She felt light and good in the warm sun. She was ten, and nothing existed for her but her song, the stick clutched in her dark brown hand, and the tat-de-ta-ta-ta of accompaniment,</p>\n<p>Turning her back on the rusty boards of her family&#39;s sharecropper cabin, Myop walked along the fence till it ran into the stream made by the spring. Around the spring, where the family got drinking water, silver ferns and wildflowers grew. Along the shallow banks pigs rooted. Myop watched the tiny white bubbles disrupt the thin black scale of soil and the water that silently rose and slid away down the stream.</p>\n<p>She had explored the woods behind the house many times. Often, in late autumn, her mother took her to gather nuts among the fallen leaves. Today she made her own path, bouncing this way and that way, vaguely keeping an eye out for snakes. She found, in addition to various common but pretty ferns and leaves, an armful of strange blue flowers with velvety ridges and a sweet suds bush full of the brown, fragrant buds.</p>\n<p>By twelve o&#39;clock, her arms laden with sprigs of her findings, she was a mile or more from home. She had often been as far before, but the strangeness of the land made it not as pleasant as her usual haunts. It seemed gloomy in the little cove in which she found herself. The air was damp, the silence close and deep.</p>\n<p>Myop began to circle back to the house, back to the peacefulness of the morning. It was then she stepped smack into his eyes. Her heel became lodged in the broken ridge between brow and nose, and she reached down quickly, unafraid, to free herself. It was only when she saw his naked grin that she gave a little yelp of surprise.</p>\n<p>He had been a tall man. From feet to neck covered a long space. His head lay beside him. When she pushed back the leaves and layers of earth and debris Myop saw that he&#39;d had large white teeth, all of them cracked or broken, long fingers, and very big bones. All his clothes had rotted away except some threads of blue denim from his overalls. The buckles of the overall had turned green.</p>\n<p>Myop gazed around the spot with interest. Very near where she&#39;d stepped into the head was a wild pink rose. As she picked it to add to her bundle she noticed a raised mound, a ring, around the rose&#39;s root. It was the rotted remains of a noose, a bit of shredding plowline, now blending benignly into the soil. Around an overhanging limb of a great spreading oak clung another piece. Frayed, rotted, bleached, and frazzled--barely there--but spinning restlessly in the breeze. Myop laid down her flowers.</p>\n<p>And the summer was over.</p>\n","Nostalgia.html":"<h1 id=\"nostalgia\">Nostalgia</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-martina-barrera-hernandez\">By Martina Barrera-Hernandez</h3>\n<p>back then,&lt;/br&gt;\nno rivers seemed so,&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;\nwide&lt;/br&gt;\nno stone walls so,&lt;/br&gt;\ndaunting&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>rivers?&lt;/br&gt;\njust puddles&lt;/br&gt;\nand&lt;/br&gt;\nwalls?&lt;/br&gt;\njust piles of rocks&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>cardboard boxes&lt;/br&gt;\nweren’t just&lt;/br&gt;\nflimsy combinations of paper,&lt;/br&gt;\nbut&lt;/br&gt;\ncastles and ships&lt;/br&gt;\nrockets and fortresses&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>a stick&lt;/br&gt;\nwasn’t a abandoned tree limb,&lt;/br&gt;\nbut&lt;/br&gt;\na sword&lt;/br&gt;\nor wand&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>back then,&lt;/br&gt;\nyour mind wasn’t&lt;/br&gt;\nconstrained&lt;/br&gt;\ncontained&lt;/br&gt;\nconfined&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>take me back&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n","Raising the Bar.html":"<h1 id=\"raising-the-bar\">Raising the Bar</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-marcia-mcnutt\">By Marcia McNutt</h3>\n<p>Numbers. Lots and lots of numbers. It is hard to find a paper published in Science or any other journal that is not full of numbers. Interpretation of those numbers provides the basis for the conclusions, as well as an assessment of the confidence in those conclusions. But unfortunately, there have been far too many cases where the quantitative analysis of those numbers has been flawed, causing doubt about the authors&#39; interpretation and uncertainty about the result. Furthermore, it is not realistic to expect that a technical reviewer, chosen for her or his expertise in the topical subject matter or experimental protocol, will also be an expert in data analysis. For that reason, with much help from the American Statistical Association, Science has established, effective 1 July 2014, a Statistical Board of Reviewing Editors (SBoRE), consisting of experts in various aspects of statistics and data analysis, to provide better oversight of the interpretation of observational data.</p>\n<p>For those familiar with the role of Science&#39;s Board of Reviewing Editors (BoRE), the function of the SBoRE will be slightly different. Members of the BoRE perform a rapid quality check of manuscripts and recommend which should receive indepth review by technical specialists. Members of the SBoRE will receive manuscripts that have been identified by editors, BoRE members, or possibly reviewers as needing additional scrutiny of the data analysis or statistical treatment. The SBoRE member assesses what the issue is that requires screening and suggests experts from the statistics community to provide it.</p>\n<p>So why is Science taking this additional step? Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal. We want to continue to take reasonable measures to verify the accuracy of those results. We believe that establishing the SBoRE will help avoid honest mistakes and raise the standards for data analysis, particularly when sophisticated approaches are needed. But even when taking added precautions, no review system is infallible, and no combination of reviewers can be expected to uncover all of the ways in which the interpretation of results may have gone wrong. In particular, it is difficult for reviewers to detect whether authors have approached the study with a lack of bias in their data collection and presentation.</p>\n<p>I recall a study that I conducted years ago involving a global analysis of some oceanographic features that I was modeling to understand the rheology of oceanic plates on million-year time scales. I had only a handful of data points—perhaps a dozen or so—and the fit to my model failed a significance test. Clearly, throwing out a few of the data points by declaring them “outliers” would have improved the fit dramatically, and in fact I even recall a reviewer of the paper commenting: “Can&#39;t you make the data fit the model better?”</p>\n<p>Really?</p>\n<p>The editor published the paper despite the lousy fit of the model to the data. It was not too long before it was realized that those “outliers” were the key to a more complete understanding of the long-term rheological behavior of the oceanic plates. Although the model in the earlier paper needed an overhaul, the fundamental observations, because they were presented without bias, inspired much further progress in the field.</p>\n<p>In the years since, I have been amazed at how many scientists have never considered that their data might be presented with bias. There are fundamental truths that may be missed when bias is unintentionally overlooked, or worse yet, when data are “massaged.” Especially as we enter an era of “big data,” we should raise the bar ever higher in scrutinizing the analyses that take us from observations to understanding.</p>\n","The Conqueror Worm.html":"<h1>The Conqueror Worm</h1>\n<h3>By Edgar Allan Poe</h3>\n<div class=\"poem\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Lo! ’t is a gala night </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the lonesome latter years!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">An angel throng, bewinged, bedight </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp; In veils, and drowned in tears,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Sit in a theatre, to see </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A play of hopes and fears, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">While the orchestra breathes fitfully&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of the spheres. </div>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Mimes, in the form of God on high,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutter and mumble low, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">And hither and thither fly— </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere puppets they, who come and go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">At bidding of vast formless things </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shift the scenery to and fro, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Flapping from out their Condor wings </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible Wo! </div>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">That motley drama—oh, be sure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall not be forgot! </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">With its Phantom chased for evermore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a crowd that seize it not, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Through a circle that ever returneth in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the self-same spot, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">And much of Madness, and more of Sin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Horror the soul of the plot. </div>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">But see, amid the mimic rout, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crawling shape intrude! </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">A blood-red thing that writhes from out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenic solitude! </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">The mimes become its food, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">And seraphs sob at vermin fangs </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human gore imbued. </div>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">Out—out are the lights—out all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, over each quivering form, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">The curtain, a funeral pall, </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes down with the rush of a storm,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">While the angels, all pallid and wan,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprising, unveiling, affirm </div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 1em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n","The Crucible.html":"<h1 id=\"the-crucible\">The Crucible</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-arthur-miller\">By Arthur Miller</h3>\n<p>Proctor: No, no.

Scott Fitzgerald</h3>\n<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\n“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember.”— she added ——” a conversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why — not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”\n“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.</p>\n","The Justices and a Botched Execution.html":"<h1 id=\"the-justices-and-a-botched-execution\">The Justices and a Botched Execution</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-the-new-york-times-editorial-board\">By The New York Times Editorial Board</h3>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear a constitutional challenge to Oklahoma’s lethal-injection drug protocol, which last April left a man writhing in agony on the killing table for 43 minutes.</p>\n<p>In the spectacularly botched execution, the condemned man, Clayton Lockett, first received an untested sedative, midazolam, but it failed to knock him out. As prison officials scrambled to pump the deadly drugs into his veins, he awoke, tried to sit up and said, “The drugs aren’t working,” before finally succumbing to a heart attack.</p>\n<p>After that debacle, Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma ordered an independent review of the state’s execution procedures, which ultimately blamed a misplaced intravenous line in Mr. Lockett’s groin. In December, a federal judge ruled that the state’s procedure was constitutional, clearing the way for the executions of four more men. Those inmates turned to the Supreme Court to stay their executions on the grounds that the drug is not an effective anesthetic and creates an intolerable risk of pain, but the court refused. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the dissent, pointed out that the state expert who testified that midazolam works relied on the website drugs.com.</p>\n<p>One week later, the justices voted to take up the case, Warner v. Gross, but they had to change its name because the original lead plaintiff, Charles Warner, had been executed in the meantime. It is now named after the man next in line to die, Richard Glossip. (The court put the remaining executions on hold pending the ultimate ruling.) The justices considered lethal injection once before, in 2008, when they upheld Kentucky’s protocol, which did not include midazolam. The question before them now is whether the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Because this is the death penalty, where logic often does not apply, the justices will also consider the bizarre question of whether someone challenging a lethal-injection protocol must identify drugs the state could use that would cause less pain.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma, perhaps sensing that such lawsuits are not going away, is not waiting for the court to decide. On April 17, Governor Fallin signed a bill approving another method of supposedly pain-free execution: nitrogen gas. There are no reports of nitrogen gas ever being used to carry out a death sentence, but that did not faze her or Oklahoma legislators, who voted almost unanimously in favor of the law.</p>\n<p>State Representative Mike Christian, a former highway patrol trooper who wrote the bill, called nitrogen gas “fast and painless” and “foolproof.” Of course, that is exactly what people said about lethal injection when it began to be used in the 1970s. In fact, versions of this debate have been going on for more than a century, as states have continued to look for more “civilized” or “humane” execution methods — from the electric chair to cyanide gas to lethal injection. And each time, the new method has resulted in executions just as tortured and brutal as those under its predecessors.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the search for more ways to kill may be losing steam as public views change. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that only 56 percent of Americans approve of capital punishment — the lowest level in four decades. Among Democrats the number is 40 percent. But even in deep-red Nebraska, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly this month to abolish the death penalty.</p>\n<p>Whatever the justices decide about Oklahoma’s protocol, more Americans are finding that there is no form of state-sponsored killing that can be civilized or humane.</p>\n","The Tell-Tale Heart.html":"<h1 id=\"the-tell-tale-heart\">The Tell-Tale Heart</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-edgar-allan-poe\">By Edgar Allan Poe</h3>\n<p>TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p>\n<p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man&#39;s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</p>\n<p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch&#39;s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</p>\n<p>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot;</p>\n<p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.</p>\n<p>Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --&quot;It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor,&quot; or &quot;It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.&quot; Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.</p>\n<p>When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.</p>\n<p>It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man&#39;s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.</p>\n<p>And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man&#39;s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.</p>\n<p>But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man&#39;s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man&#39;s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more.</p>\n<p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.</p>\n<p>I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!</p>\n<p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o&#39;clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.</p>\n<p>I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.</p>\n<p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.</p>\n<p>No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!</p>\n<p>&quot;Villains!&quot; I shrieked, &quot;dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!&quot;</p>\n","To the Swimmer.html":"<h1 id=\"to-the-swimmer\">To the Swimmer</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-countee-cullen\">By Countee Cullen</h3>\n<p>Now as I watch you, strong of arm and endurance, battling and struggling\nWith the waves that rush against you, ever with invincible strength returning\nInto my heart, grown each day more tranquil and peaceful, comes a fierce longing\nOf mind and soul that will not be appeased until, like you, I breast yon deep and boundless expanse of blue.</p>\n<p>With an outward stroke of power intense your mighty arm goes forth,\nCleaving its way through waters that rise and roll, ever a ceaseless vigil keeping\nOver the treasures beneath.</p>\n<p>My heart goes out to you of dauntless courage and spirit indomitable,\nAnd though my lips would speak, my spirit forbids me to ask,\n“Is your heart as true as your arm?”</p>\n","Upturned Face.html":"<h1 id=\"upturned-face\">Upturned Face</h1>\n<h3 id=\"by-stephen-crane\">By Stephen Crane</h3>\n<p>&quot;What will we do now?&quot; said the adjutant, troubled and excited.</p>\n<p>&quot;Bury him,&quot; said Timothy Lean.</p>\n<p>The two officers looked down close to their toes where lay the body of their comrade. The face was chalk-blue; gleaming eyes stared at the sky. Over the two upright figures was a windy sound of bullets, and on the top of the hill Lean&#39;s prostrate company of Spitzbergen infantry was firing measured volleys.</p>\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t you think it would be better--&quot; began the adjutant. &quot;We might leave him until tomorrow.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Lean. &quot;I can&#39;t hold that post an hour longer. I&#39;ve got to fall back, and we&#39;ve got to bury old Bill.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the adjutant, at once. &quot;Your men got intrenching tools?&quot;</p>\n<p>Lean shouted back to his little line, and two men came slowly, one with a pick, one with a shovel. They started in the direction of the Rostina sharp-shooters. Bullets cracked near their ears. &quot;Dig here,&quot; said Lean gruffly. The men, thus caused to lower their glances to the turf, became hurried and frightened merely because they could not look to see whence the bullets came. The dull beat of the pick striking the earth sounded amid the swift snap of close bullets. Presently the other private began to shovel.</p>\n<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said the adjutant, slowly, &quot;we&#39;d better search his clothes for--things.&quot;</p>\n<p>Lean nodded. Together in curious abstraction they looked at the body. Then Lean stirred his shoulders suddenly, arousing himself.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;we&#39;d better see what he&#39;s got.&quot; He dropped to his knees, and his hands approached the body of the dead officer. But his hands wavered over the buttons of the tunic. The first button was brick- red with drying blood, and he did not seem to dare touch it.</p>\n<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; said the adjutant, hoarsely.</p>\n<p>Lean stretched his wooden hand, and his fingers fumbled the blood- stained buttons. At last he rose with ghastly face. He had gathered a watch, a whistle, a pipe, a tobacco pouch, a handkerchief, a little case of cards and papers. He looked at the adjutant. There was a silence. The adjutant was feeling that he had been a coward to make Lean do all the grisly business.</p>\n<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Lean, &quot;that&#39;s all, I think. You have his sword and revolver?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the adjutant, his face working, and then he burst out in a sudden strange fury at the two privates. &quot;Why don&#39;t you hurry up with that grave? What are you doing, anyhow? Hurry, do you hear? I never saw such stupid--&quot;</p>\n<p>Even as he cried out in his passion the two men were laboring for their lives. Ever overhead the bullets were spitting.</p>\n<p>The grave was finished, It was not a masterpiece--a poor little shallow thing. Lean and the adjutant again looked at each other in a curious silent communication.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the adjutant croaked out a weird laugh. It was a terrible laugh, which had its origin in that part of the mind which is first moved by the singing of the nerves. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, humorously to Lean, &quot;I suppose we had best tumble him in.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lean. The two privates stood waiting, bent over their implements. &quot;I suppose,&quot; said Lean, &quot;it would be better if we laid him in ourselves.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the adjutant. Then apparently remembering that he had made Lean search the body, he stooped with great fortitude and took hold of the dead officer&#39;s clothing. Lean joined him. Both were particular that their fingers should not feel the corpse. They tugged away; the corpse lifted, heaved, toppled, flopped into the grave, and the two officers, straightening, looked again at each other--they were always looking at each other. They sighed with relief.</p>\n<p>The adjutant said, &quot;I suppose we should--we should say something. Do you know the service, Tim?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;They don&#39;t read the service until the grave is filled in,&quot; said Lean, pressing his lips to an academic expression.</p>\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t they?&quot; said the adjutant, shocked that he had made the mistake.</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; he cried, suddenly, &quot;let us--let us say something--while he can hear us.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Lean. &quot;Do you know the service?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t remember a line of it,&quot; said the adjutant.</p>\n<p>Lean was extremely dubious. &quot;I can repeat two lines, but--&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, do it,&quot; said the adjutant. &quot;Go as far as you can. That&#39;s better than nothing. And the beasts have got our range exactly.&quot;</p>\n<p>Lean looked at his two men. &quot;Attention,&quot; he barked. The privates came to attention with a click, looking much aggrieved. The adjutant lowered his helmet to his knee. Lean, bareheaded, he stood over the grave. The Rostina sharpshooters fired briskly.</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, Father, our friend has sunk in the deep waters of death, but his spirit has leaped toward Thee as the bubble arises from the lips of the drowning. Perceive, we beseech, O Father, the little flying bubble, and--&quot;.</p>\n<p>Lean, although husky and ashamed, had suffered no hesitation up to this point, but he stopped with a hopeless feeling and looked at the corpse.</p>\n<p>The adjutant moved uneasily. &quot;And from Thy superb heights--&quot; he began, and then he too came to an end.</p>\n<p>&quot;And from Thy superb heights,&quot; said Lean.</p>\n<p>The adjutant suddenly remembered a phrase in the back part of the Spitzbergen burial service, and he exploited it with the triumphant manner of a man who has recalled everything, and can go on.</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, God, have mercy--&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Oh, God, have mercy--&quot; said Lean.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mercy,&quot; repeated the adjutant, in quick failure.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mercy,&quot; said Lean. And then he was moved by some violence of feeling, for he turned suddenly upon his two men and tigerishly said, &quot;Throw the dirt in.&quot;</p>\n<p>The fire of the Rostina sharpshooters was accurate and continuous.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the aggrieved privates came forward with his shovel. He lifted his first shovel-load of earth, and for a moment of inexplicable hesitation it was held poised above this corpse, which from its chalk- blue face looked keenly out from the grave. Then the soldier emptied his shovel on--on the feet.</p>\n<p>Timothy Lean felt as if tons had been swiftly lifted from off his forehead. He had felt that perhaps the private might empty the shovel on--on the face. It had been emptied on the feet. There was a great point gained there--ha, ha!--the first shovelful had been emptied on the feet. How satisfactory!</p>\n<p>The adjutant began to babble. &quot;Well, of course--a man we&#39;ve messed with all these years--impossible--you can&#39;t, you know, leave your intimate friends rotting on the field. Go on, for God&#39;s sake, and shovel, you!&quot;</p>\n<p>The man with the shovel suddenly ducked, grabbed his left arm with his right hand, and looked at his officer for orders. Lean picked the shovel from the ground. &quot;Go to the rear,&quot; he said to the wounded man. He also addressed the other private. &quot;You get under cover, too; I&#39;ll finish this business.&quot;</p>\n<p>The wounded man scrambled hard still for the top of the ridge without devoting any glances to the direction whence the bullets came, and the other man followed at an equal pace; but he was different, in that he looked back anxiously three times.</p>\n<p>This is merely the way--often--of the hit and unhit.</p>\n<p>Timothy Lean filled the shovel, hesitated, and then in a movement which was like a gesture of abhorrence he flung the dirt into the grave, and as it landed it made a sound--plop! Lean suddenly stopped and mopped his brow--a tired laborer.</p>\n<p>&quot;Perhaps we have been wrong,&quot; said the adjutant. His glance wavered stupidly. &quot;It might have been better if we hadn&#39;t buried him just at this time. Of course, if we advance to-morrow the body would have been--&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Damn you,&quot; said Lean, &quot;shut your mouth!&quot; He was not the senior officer.</p>\n<p>He again filled the shovel and flung the earth. Always the earth made that sound--plop! For a space Lean worked frantically, like a man digging himself out of danger.</p>\n<p>Soon there was nothing to be seen but the chalk-blue face. Lean filled the shovel. &quot;Good God,&quot; he cried to the adjutant. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you turn him somehow when you put him in? This--&quot; Then Lean began to stutter.</p>\n<p>The adjutant understood. He was pale to the lips. &quot;Go on, man,&quot; he cried, beseechingly, almost in a shout. Lean swung back the shovel.

During that time, the city’s crime rate, once one of the highest in the country, had fallen by nearly half, but some residents worried that the tactics that Zumalt and his colleagues had employed, such as aggressive traffic stops, were excessive. Others wondered whether, in a city that is almost half black, an African-American police chief would finally be appointed, but Mayor Keith Summey chose Eddie Driggers, a white former police officer and chaplain who happened to be his neighbor. “I don’t know Mr. Driggers from Adam’s housecat,” Ed Bryant, the head of the North Charleston N.A.A.C.P., told the Post &amp; Courier. Another association official said, “I don’t know the new guy, but I hope we will get lucky.”</p>\n<p>They got to know Chief Driggers better at a press conference last Wednesday, when he and Mayor Summey took questions from reporters about the arrest of Officer Michael Slager, on charges of having murdered Walter Scott. The previous Saturday, Slager, who is white, had pulled over Scott, a fifty-year-old African-American, supposedly because a brake light on his car wasn’t working. A video from Slager’s dashboard camera shows him taking Scott’s license and, while he returns to his car to check it, Scott running out of view; a passenger remained in the car. Scott owed child support, and as a result there was an outstanding warrant in his name. There are sounds on the video of a pursuit. A twenty-three-year-old man named Feidin Santana, who was walking nearby, saw Slager and Scott struggling and heard the distinctive sound of a Taser, and filmed the ensuing scene with his phone camera.</p>\n<p>That video shows Scott, who was unarmed, making another break for it, across a stretch of grass. The Supreme Court found, in 1985, that police do not have a right to shoot someone simply because he is fleeing. (That decision, Tennessee v. Garner, involved a black eighth grader who had stolen a purse and ten dollars from a house, and was shot while climbing a fence to get away.) Slager, under no apparent threat or duress, fires eight rounds from his pistol*. Scott is hit four times in the back and once in the ear. As he lies face down on the ground, Slager cuffs him. The officer jogs back to where they had been struggling, picks something up—it may have been the Taser—and drops it near Scott’s body. He then radios, “Shots fired and subject is down. He took my Taser.” A police-department incident report emphasized that Slager spoke these words just seconds after the confrontation, as if their immediacy were a sign of their honesty. Slager’s lawyer said that Scott had tried to “overpower” him, and so Slager was forced to shoot. At that point, Santana had not released the video—he has said that he feared possible retaliation and wanted to see if Slager would tell the truth. Then he gave it to Scott’s family, who made it public on Tuesday. Slager’s lawyer quit the case after seeing the footage.</p>\n<p>At the press conference, Driggers said, “I was sickened by what I saw.” He and the mayor did not try to justify or even explain the shooting, deferring to state investigators. Instead, they talked about Scott and his family, whom they had visited earlier. “I got to meet a daddy who is in mourning, a mama who is in mourning, and we talked father to father,” Driggers said. “However you give respect to individuals, give them the respect that they deserve during this time.” Summey also used the word “respect” and called the Scotts, who had asked for calm, “wonderful,” “outstanding,” and “suffering.” (“We’re here to support them.”) Driggers said that his job was to protect “you—all of you.” More important, once he and Summey had seen the video, there had been no hesitation in charging Slager with murder and firing him from the force.</p>\n<p>The mayor also said that he had ordered enough wearable cameras for every officer on the North Charleston force. Even protesters who had interrupted him about other issues, such as the lack of diversity in a department that is eighty per cent white, applauded that. Video has come to be seen as a near-panacea, although some privacy rules might be needed before turning every policeman into a roving video recorder. But cameras alone won’t solve the problem. In Cleveland, the death of Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old boy who was playing with a toy gun when he was shot by a police officer, was captured on video, but investigations in that case have progressed slowly. The choking of Eric Garner, on Staten Island, was taped, but no indictment followed. If North Charleston avoids becoming another Ferguson—a place where a police shooting exposes and accelerates a broader breakdown in civic trust—it will be due not just to the video but also to the manner in which Driggers and Summey responded to it.</p>\n<p>Videos, like pictures, are effective only when the people looking at them are willing to really see what’s there. Photographs of the battered body of Emmett Till, a child murdered in Mississippi in 1955, galvanized public opinion after they were printed in Jet. Just a few years earlier, postcards of lynchings had been treated as souvenirs. The capacity for self-delusion, despite visual evidence, is great: last September, another South Carolina officer approached an African-American man at a gas station, asked for his license, and shot him when he reached for it. (The man, who called the officer “sir” even as he was sprawled on the ground, survived.) The officer then called in a report that was blatantly contradicted by video from his own dash cam.</p>\n<p>New technology is reshaping the civic obligation of bearing witness. At the same time, the dramatic fall in crime rates demands a new relationship between the police and the community. Not all police departments have fully adjusted, some have done so badly, and others realize that they have much to learn. When Jon Zumalt, Driggers’s predecessor, spoke to the Post &amp; Courier about his career, he listed, among his chief regrets, his handling, early in his tenure, of the police shooting death of a black man named Asberry Wylder. Zumalt doubted not the use of force but the way that he had soured his dealings with the people he served by talking about the witnesses who contradicted his officers’ stories as if they were all fantasists or liars. It was, he said, “a rookie mistake.” ♦</p>\n","Whitman's Pantry.html":"<div class=\"poem\">\r\n<h1>Whitman's Pantry</h1>\r\n<h3>By T.R.
